### Task1:

##### Online Shop System

A simplified online shop system where users can add products to a shopping cart, view the total cost, and place an order.

## Features

- **Product Management**:  
  Define a `Product` class to represent individual products, each with a `name` and `price`.

- **Shopping Cart**:  
  Define a `ShoppingCart` class to manage the shopping cart, which includes:
  - Adding items to the cart
  - Removing items from the cart
  - Calculating the total cost of all items in the cart
  - Retrieving the list of items in the cart

- **Order Processing**:  
  Define an `OrderProcessor` class to handle the order processing logic. It includes:
  - A `placeOrder` method that prints out the details of each item in the cart (name and price) and the total cost of the order.

## Usage

1. Create sample products.
2. Add products to the shopping cart.
3. Display the total cost of items in the cart.
4. Create an instance of `OrderProcessor` and call `placeOrder` to print the order details and total cost.
